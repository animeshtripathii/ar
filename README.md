## 🚀 Overview

**ar** is a simple, browser-based Augmented Reality (AR) project. Designed for ease of use and rapid deployment, you can visualize virtual objects in your real environment right from your web browser. This project is ideal for learning AR basics, prototyping AR experiences, or embedding AR demos in other projects.

---

## ✨ Features

- **No frameworks required:** Pure HTML for fast loading and straightforward editing.
- **Instant AR experience:** Open, grant camera access, and start exploring.
- **Mobile & Desktop Support:** Works on most modern browsers and devices.
- **Customizable assets:** Swap demo models, images, or AR markers as needed.
- **Open source & MIT licensed:** Freely use and modify.

---

## 🏗️ Technology Stack

- **HTML5** for the main structure and AR embedding
- **(Optional) JavaScript** for interactions and camera access
- **(Optional) CSS** for layout and styling
- **(Optional) AR library used:** If your implementation uses something like AR.js, Model Viewer, or WebXR, mention and link it here.

## ⚡️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/animeshtripathii/ar.git
cd ar
```

### 2. Open the App

- Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- For the best AR experience, use a mobile device and allow camera access
- **Note:** Some AR features may require HTTPS. To run locally with HTTPS, use a local server:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## 🖼️ Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Allow camera permissions when prompted.
3. Point your camera at a flat surface or AR marker (if required).
4. Interact with the AR content!

---

## 🛠️ Customization

- **Change AR assets:** Replace demo images/models/markers in the `assets/` folder.
- **UI & Styles:** Edit `index.html` or add/update CSS as needed.
- **Extend AR capabilities:** Integrate with libraries like AR.js, Model Viewer, or Three.js for more features.
